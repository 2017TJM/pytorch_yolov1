## Yolo v1: 
	It's too hard to train yolo v1. I'm still can't recurrent the accuracy in voc datasets. I train a person class detect net in coco datasets , it works but still not well. I think the yolo has too little boxes to predict the object.

### Train Method:
	I pick the images with person class from coco datasets . The trainsets contains about 11k picture.
	I train 100 epochs with lr 0.0001.
	You can reset the train parameter to train your datasets.

	the training logs.
